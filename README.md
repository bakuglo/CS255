Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The owner of DriverPass aims to create a website dedicated to driver training, believing inadequate instruction is causing high failure rates among new drivers. The proposed system will allow student drivers to register, create accounts, choose driving packages, access online training and exams, and schedule on-road training. The owner will have access to all student and employee accounts.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe that what I did well was the diagrams that were required to be created, and I feel as if I did well describing how each diagram pertains to the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would choose project one and I personally would go into further detail when describing the project requirements.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I wanted to ensure I thoroughly documented all the requirements, separating each aspect related to the client, the students, the owner, and the employees, which simplified the process. The client’s requirements are crucial because without them, the project wouldn't be useful or complete.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In designing the software, I would first gather the requirements for the new functionalities. Then, I would design the system and incorporate the new features. To further analyze, I would gather feedback and consider the system constraints. From there, I would implement any necessary fixes or changes to improve the system.
